Some problems can be solved using BFS algorithms, the only missing thing is the link from child to parent, create a map to save the link from child to parent & solve the problem using GRAPH algorithms.

Root To Leaf Path Sum : SIMPLE BFS https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/root-to-leaf-paths-sum/1 

The tree represented using array, the left child : 2*index + 1 & right child : 2*index + 2, 0 based indexing, the parent element : (index-1)/2

The problem that requires L + (Current Pivot) + R type problems, return the values from Left & Right, check the conditions on current node, if satisfied, store the solution to a reference variable. The solution is achieved at a point (reference variable).
